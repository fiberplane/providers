# Fiberplane Provider Development Kit

This crate provides high-level macros and abstractions for more ergonomic
provider development.

## Overview

The main traits and macros you will interact with from this crate are:

* [`pdk_query_types!`][pdk_query_types] - A macro for defining your query types
  and their handlers.
* [`pdk_export!`][pdk_export] - A macro to export functions as part of the
  provider protocol.
* [`ConfigSchema`][ConfigSchema] - A macro for deriving a schema from your
  config struct.
* [`QuerySchema`][QuerySchema] - A macro for deriving a schema from your query
  struct(s).
* [`ProviderData`][ProviderData] - A trait and derive macro for types that you
  wish to pass around as provider data using [`Blob`s][Blob].
